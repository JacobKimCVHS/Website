            8/25/23 - During this day, our class encountered a challenge to utilize eight pipes to transfer a ball into a bucket. Although we had eight pipes, there were more people than pipes. This made us create a strategy to successfully bring the marble to the marbe with the involvement of everyone. Although we failed at first, we started getting used to it and created the plan to bring the pipes at a flatter slope in order to safely bring the marble into the bucket. With this challenge, I have learned that I must rely on others sometimes in order to successfully fulfill a task.

            9/11/23 - During this day, we took a quiz about mechanical engineering. We also used tinkercad to create a design for our project. By using tinkercad, we can learn knowledge about how to use programming for engineering. Tinkercad also allowed us to create prototypes for our project and test certain ideas if the project will work with a certain idea. We have also created some part of the project with cardboard.

            9/25/23 We were working on a project that focused on moving a ball in a certain structure that people made in order to pop a balloon. Although we had some trouble with time and efficiency, we figured out how to work together and create a tower that will hold up the ball and its impact. The structure that we created had three inclined slides, a lever, and platforms to slow the impact of the ball. After some tries, we successfully managed the ball to reach the lever and allow the needle to pop the balloon.

            9/29/23 Today, we dissected a computer and separated all the parts from the computer. Although we had some trouble at the start, the proccess of dissecting the computer was smoother than expected. By dissecting the computer, we learned the parts of the computer and some of their function within the computer. This helps us to learn more about engineering with computer and helps us decide if we like the computer route of engineering. After we dissected the computer, we successfully reassembled the computer to see how other computer engineers assembles a computer.

            10/6/23 Today, we made a prosthetic hand with the material of rubberbands, cardboard, tape, and strings. Although we had trouble trying to get an agreeable idea, we figured out to create four cardboard rectangles for the fingers and strap it with a string with rubberbands tied to it in order to control the fingers. Then we taped the finger with a "hand" (a big cardboard rectangle) to maintain where the finger can go. After several attempts, we successfully held the water bottle with our prosthetic hand. By doing this project, we learned more about bioengineering and the actions of bioengineer person that is building prosthetics.

            10/20/23 Today, we created a bottle rocket with the materials of a cardboard and a bottle. We attempted to make the bottle rocket to launch in the air for a period of time. The hardest part of building the bottle rocket was figuring out what our bottle rocket should have been built like. Our group decided to put three cardboard on the side as fins to help the rocket launch and have a paper cone on the top as the nose cone. As we launched the rocket, we saw how our rocket went up for a few seconds. By doing this project, we learned how ariel engineering takes a lot of time and energy, and also shows how each parts is needed in order to direct a rocket.

            10/27/23 Today, we attempted to create a water filtration by utilizing a bottle, cotton, rocks, and sand. Although we did not manage to succesfully filter the dirty water, we still managed to get the dirt away from the water. For the filtration system, we first put cotton then sand and then the rocks. By doing this lab, I noticed how filtrations are vital for people and how engineers must do it to help the people and earth.

            11/3/23 Today, we have created prototypes for our circuit. We have learned this for electrical engineering and learned how there are different types of circuit. There is also different types of current like ac and dc. The struggles for the prototype circuits were how to exactly light up the bulbs and which wire must go to which in order to create a circuit. By doing this prototype, I noticed the struggles for electrical engineers and how circuits are created from different parts such as a battery, wires, resistors and more. I have also learned the Ohm's law which is I = VR.

            11/9/23 Today, we designed multiple circuits with real tools. We utilized the breadboard in order to connect the circuit and had a tool in order to get the battery for the circuit. We made multiple circuits, including the parallel and single circuit. Although we had trouble for some of the circuits, we managed to successfully build all the circuits. With this lab, I have noticed how each component of the circuit is vital in order to create an output.

            12/1/23 Today, we created a business plan for a product that will hopefully succeed. We first thought of a good product that will be a good start and made an idea of fog removing glasses, since it is unique and it is cheaper than most regular glasses with extra technology. This is also influenced by the car ac as it works the same way to remove fogs. After we though of the idea we created the presentation and used it to support the product. This ultimately showed me the hardship of business engineering but also how fun and interesting it is.

      <li> The weight of our bridge was 32.7 grams.</li>
      <li> The weight held by our bridge was 447 grams.</li>
      <li> The ratio of weight of bridge to weight held was 1:13.7</li>
      <li> The heaviest part of our bridge was the edges or sides of our bridge. We made those the heaviest because it will distribute the tension force from the bucket and the gravitational force. Stacking the spaghetti sticks on top of each other mostly made the weight of the bridge.</li>
      <li> The design of our bridge mostly came from our minds. However, we also got inspiration on the internet of other bridges to see how a bridge can hold up and function. We saw that these bridges often distributed their weight in one way or another. Therefore we tried to create a bridge that is even in the weight.</li>
    <li> The design of the bridge was not what we intended and it was worse than we expected since our prototype of the bridge was better at holding the weight than the actual product.</li>
    <li> The point of failure of our bridge was not stabilizing the middle of the bridge. This was the expected weak point since we saw that the bridge was bending too much when we held it.</li>
    <li> I can try to put more spaghetti's to stabilize the bridge since it can snap in the middle. However, the weight of the middle can still prolong points of failure.</li>

        1/12/24 Today, we were challenged to creat oobleck as our project for chemical engineering. In order to create oobleck, we needed two ingredients: water and corn starch. Oobleck is a material that is very weird as it becomes a solid when you put pressure but becomes liquid when you release it. When we first started, we put the corn starch first and put water little by little. With this action, we successfully created oobleck and had fun playing with it. I learned how chemical engineering is uses other material in order to create a process.

    <p>1/26/24 Today, we decided on our project to create a mousetrap car. A mouse trap car moves by its mouse trap pulling a string to move the wheels. We decided on creating a mousetrap car because it requires a skill in the hands and allow our critical thinking to make the car. To first make the car, we sketched the car and measured the heights and width of the parts of the car. After, we made a prototype of the car through tinkercad. We will now try to make the car physically.

    <p>2/14/24 Today, we have finally created the mousetrap car. The mousetrap car was tall in height and had 4 wheels. However, this mousetrap car failed since the wheels from the back was not working and kept on flipping over. The estimated amount of distance the car was supposed to move was 3.48 m. In our next week, I hope we can fix this and make the mouse trap car to move by replacing the connection of the wheels with skewers and make accurate design measurements. We also learned how difficult it is to create a car through this project.</p>

    <p> 2/26/24 Today, we have created our final mousetrap car. Fortunately, it worked and started moving unlike the first mousetrap car. Also, this mousetrap car move the most distance out of all the mousetrap cars from the class. From the first mousetrap car, we learned that in order for the wheels to move, we needed straws for the wheel to move and put skewers for the wheels. We also decreased the mass of the body of the mouse trap car since it will help increase the acceleration of the car, making it to move more. The part that we messed up on the first car was making the wheels to move, but we have figured it out with the skewers and straws. We estimated the distance of the car for 32 ft, but we saw how the car reached over 64 feet. I learned how we can use these failures in order to create a successful project and see the reward of engineering.</p>

    <p> 3/4/24 Today, we decided on creating on an egg drop project. We decided on having the egg wrapped with straws to limit the amount of momentum put on to the egg. We also planned on creating a parachute by attaching strings to a garbage bag to increase air resistance and increasing the time of the fall to withstand the fall. We created a prototype by doing a tinkercad to fully know what we are going to do for the project when we create it.</p>
    <img src = "eggcad.png" width="180px" height = "120px">
    <p>3/12/24 Today, we created our egg drop project physically. We decided to have a cardboard box to hold the egg and is attached to a trash bag to act as a parachute. We also put cotton inside the box to lessen the crash on the egg. Fortunately, this project was a success as it protected the egg from the fall, avoiding any damage on the egg. By doing this project, I can see how we can use our education and knowledge to create real life object that can do certain functions for our desires.</p>

    <p> 4/3/24 Today, we built a paperboat to see how far it will go when on water. We first made a tinkercad to see the prototype and we planned to create it with a rubberband with a stick to make it move even more. When we built it, we though it was good. However, it failed and moved a bit less than we anticipated. In this project, we learned what can be better to create a boat with its size and shape. </p>

        4/11/24 Today, we built a stick that would hold a water balloon from falling. We first used a meter stick and prioritized on rubber bands in order to hold the ballon in place. We first planned to put the balloon on the top of the meterstick to help hold it and used cardboard to help the rubberband to be more built in. When we were testing the stick, it was able to hold the balloon. However, when we ran with it in the actual performance, it fell immediately. I learned how engineering is very useful in day to day life and see how hard it can be.

        5/20/24 We created a Boat Project Analysis to plan what our boat will consist of and how it will be built. We decided to have a boat that had a large surface area to make it float. We also planned to make it pointy to try and make it less resistant to water. We also made a tinkercad to see a prototype of our boat.

    <p> 5/26/24 We started creating the cardboat. Although we had some trouble with taping some parts of the boat, we managed to connect the parts. Some of the areas that we needed to tape couldn't be reached with our hands and needed help, so we used rules and other objects to reach areas. We also changed the looks of the boat to make it a bit cooler, but this may have ruined the boat's function. Instead of looking like a standard boat, it looked more like an alien ship and we believed that the slanted walls will help avoid the water from coming in. I hope the boat does not sink. </p>

    <p> 5/26/24 We finished creating our boat and we put the rest of our tape on the floor of the boat. However, we couldn't fill the whole floor with tape. We then tested the performance of our boat by going to the CV's swimming pool. However, the boat sank in 15 seconds and did not go as far as we expected. The floor of the boat was extremely wet, making the floor destroyed and ultimately letting the water in the boat from the floor. Although it was an unsuccessful attempt, I had fun doing this project and making the cardboard boat. </p>
