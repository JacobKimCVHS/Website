            8/25/23 - During this day, our class encountered a challenge to utilize eight pipes to transfer a ball into a bucket. Although we had eight pipes, there were more people than pipes. This made us create a strategy to successfully bring the marble to the marbe with the involvement of everyone. Although we failed at first, we started getting used to it and created the plan to bring the pipes at a flatter slope in order to safely bring the marble into the bucket. With this challenge, I have learned that I must rely on others sometimes in order to successfully fulfill a task.

            9/11/23 - During this day, we took a quiz about mechanical engineering. We also used tinkercad to create a design for our project. By using tinkercad, we can learn knowledge about how to use programming for engineering. Tinkercad also allowed us to create prototypes for our project and test certain ideas if the project will work with a certain idea. We have also created some part of the project with cardboard.

            9/25/23 We were working on a project that focused on moving a ball in a certain structure that people made in order to pop a balloon. Although we had some trouble with time and efficiency, we figured out how to work together and create a tower that will hold up the ball and its impact. The structure that we created had three inclined slides, a lever, and platforms to slow the impact of the ball. After some tries, we successfully managed the ball to reach the lever and allow the needle to pop the balloon.

            9/29/23 Today, we dissected a computer and separated all the parts from the computer. Although we had some trouble at the start, the proccess of dissecting the computer was smoother than expected. By dissecting the computer, we learned the parts of the computer and some of their function within the computer. This helps us to learn more about engineering with computer and helps us decide if we like the computer route of engineering. After we dissected the computer, we successfully reassembled the computer to see how other computer engineers assembles a computer.

            10/6/23 Today, we made a prosthetic hand with the material of rubberbands, cardboard, tape, and strings. Although we had trouble trying to get an agreeable idea, we figured out to create four cardboard rectangles for the fingers and strap it with a string with rubberbands tied to it in order to control the fingers. Then we taped the finger with a "hand" (a big cardboard rectangle) to maintain where the finger can go. After several attempts, we successfully held the water bottle with our prosthetic hand. By doing this project, we learned more about bioengineering and the actions of bioengineer person that is building prosthetics.
