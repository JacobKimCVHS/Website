            8/25/23 - In this day, our class encountered a challenge to utilize eight pipes to transfer a ball into a bucket. Although we had eight pipes, there were more people than pipes. This made us create a strategy to successfully bring the marble to the marbe with the involvement of everyone. Although we failed at first, we started getting used to it and created the plan to bring the pipes at a flatter slope in order to safely bring the marble into the bucket. With this challenge, I have learned that I must rely on others sometimes in order to successfully fulfill a task.
